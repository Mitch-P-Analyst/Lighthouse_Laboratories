# Lighthouse Laboratories

## Overview

This repository provides a structured overview of Python-based coursework from the Lighthouse Labs Data Analytics and Data Science bootcamp programs.

It contains Jupyter Notebooks, Python scripts, and Markdown files sourced from the Lighthouse Labs Compass curriculum. The course content has been organized into six progressive categories to reflect a linear learning path, designed to gradually build data skills and Python proficiency.

While the repository has been structured to support self-paced learning, following the Lighthouse Laboratories course content, an indepth review of each notebook has not been completed. Users are encouraged to explore all files, adapt, and modify the content to suit their own learning goals.

Best of luck on your data journey. Feel free to modify this material to improve your practice and knowledge.
